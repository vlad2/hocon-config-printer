Usage: main <config-file> [options]

Parses a HOCON config file, merges all the settings from all included files,
   and writes the output to stdout.

Default output: concise:  JSON (almost) representation, no comments.

Options:
-verbose: add comments that indicate how settings were merged
-resolve: Representation can contain substitutions, ex: ${VARIABLE}, which isn't
  JSON compliant. Using -resolve will resolve all substitutions with env vars 
  (and remove the keys entirely where the values are unresolved).
  Maybe not the most useful option, because of the key removal thingie.
-help: Shows this help screen
